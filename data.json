Ellie had it too and the 1.5 lb. kitty requiring urgent, aggressive treatment was transferred to Gerdy’s. After weeks in intensive care, Ellie is now healthy and ready for adoption. Affectionate and full of beans, Ellie is high energy and must have a young, active family with children over 12 years old. Ellie must be the only pet in the home.",

Indeed, Katia, even if she is gorgeous, was not social at all! The socialization team from the shelter worked hard with Katia who is now ready to be adopted. However, she remains a cat with character. She is crazy for treats so that is how we become her friends! Katia doesn't like other cats, so she is looking for a home just for herself. The person who will adopt Katia will need to be patient and be willing to work with the adoption team and our cat behaviour specialist.",
